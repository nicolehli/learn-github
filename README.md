Repo to practice GitHub's Pull Request workflow

This is an edit following the tutorial over at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ to practice some GitHub workflow.

Hereâ€™s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

1. Created an open source repository
2. Started and managed a new branch
3. Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
4. Opened and merged a Pull Request

Then I will repeat with command line and GitHub desktop to learn the environment.
